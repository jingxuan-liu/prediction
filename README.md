# Prediction Models 
In the present project prediction models are built to predict students academic performance using their non-cognitive skills and standard testing scores (Quantative score and Verbal score). These non-cognitive skills were collected when they applied the schools. They are intellectual engagement (IE), teamwork(TW), initiative （IN), resilience (RS)， social awareness （SA), open-minedness (OP), and self-consiousness(SC).
Regression model and random forest models are built by using 70% of data as training set.
